# BCC202-TP02
This project implements a cellular automaton in C using linked lists to represent a sparse matrix. Only live cells are stored, optimizing memory usage. The automaton follows Conway's Game of Life rules, evolving based on neighbor states. Key functions manage grid initialization, evolution, and memory deallocation.
